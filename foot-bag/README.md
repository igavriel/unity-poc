California Games was one of the games I played and love.
This POC is a remake for the "Foot Bag" mini game from "California Games".
The POC was handling with unity "Coroutine" to activate colliders based on the ball location.

# California games
California Games is a sports video game released by Epyx for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1987. Branching from their Summer Games and Winter Games series, this game is a collection of outdoor sports purportedly popular in California. It ported to other home computers and video game consoles and was the pack-in game for the Atari Lynx when that system launched in 1989. The game was successful and spawned a sequel, California Games II.

Here is the information converted into a Markdown table:

|------------------|--------|
| One Trick        | 1000   |
| Two Tricks       | 3000   |

| Eleven Tricks    | 99000  |

### Strategies
- Try to only perform the low scoring tricks once per attempt, as it will  only be needed for the valuable Bonus Points they help accumulate.

- Try to have a set routine for your Foot Bagger to follow, which maximizes  the amount of tricks and minimizes the amount of time with the hackey sack  on the ground.  The only time the hackey sack should touch down onto the ground is to use a Jester (putting it there), followed by performing a  Horseshoe, taking out two tricks for one time the hackey sack is on the
 ground, instead of two separate instances.

- Note that a Seagull bash will interrupt any Trick Combination being performed, so try and avoid hitting them unless you are between Tricks.
