# 🔥 The Last Spark

> *In a world where light has all but faded, a single spark remains.*

**The Last Spark** is a short 2D top-down game that explores the contrast between light and darkness in a dying magical forest.

You play as **The Last Spark** — a flickering fireball born from the embers of the First Flame. The forest around you is cloaked in mist and hunted by creatures of water that seek to extinguish you. Your only hope is to find and rekindle lost flames scattered through the forest. Every flame you collect strengthens your light. Every hit from a water wraith dims it. When your light fades completely... it's game over.
