# The Last Spark

## In a world where light has all but faded, a single spark remains.

In a world where light has all but faded, a single spark remains.

You are **The Last Spark**, a flickering fireball born from the embers of the First Flame. The forest, once vibrant and warm, is now drenched in cold mist and haunted by creatures of water — relentless enemies that seek to extinguish the last trace of light.

With every **flame you collect**, your light grows, pushing back the darkness. But with each **hit by a water wraith**, your glow fades.

Journey deep into the dying forest, ignite the forgotten flames, and **rekindle the fire of the world** — or be extinguished forever.
