# 🪞 Broken Mirror

> Two sides. One fate. Control both. Survive together.

**Broken Mirror** is a dual-control endless runner game genre made in Unity. The player controls two balls on a split-screen, avoiding falling obstacles while managing coordination and survival. The game is a POC (Proof of Concept) built using basic Unity 2D objects and systems.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The screen is split vertically into two halves.
- The player controls **two balls simultaneously**, one on each side.
- **Falling triangles** and **lines of cubes** appear from the top of the screen.
- If either ball touches an obstacle, it begins to get dragged down.
- If a ball reaches the **bottom** of the screen, it's **Game Over**.
- Goal: **Survive as long as possible**.
