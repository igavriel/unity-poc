# 🪞 Broken Mirror

> Two sides. One fate. Control both missiles. Survive the flow.

**Broken Mirror** is a dual-control endless runner game made in Unity. The player controls two missile-like avatars built from basic Unity objects, racing over a mirrored river landscape. The screen is split in two — like a broken mirror — and both sides reflect a parallel challenge. The game is a POC (Proof of Concept) built using Unity's 2D system to explore synchronized gameplay and spatial awareness.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The screen is split vertically into two halves — a "broken mirror" over an endless river.
- The player controls **two missiles simultaneously**, one on each side.
- **Falling triangles** and **lines of cubes** appear from the top of the screen.
- If either player touches an obstacle, it begins to get dragged down.
- If a player reaches the **bottom** of the screen, it's **Game Over**.
- Goal: **Survive as long as possible**.
